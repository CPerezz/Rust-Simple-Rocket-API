# Rust-Simple-Rocket-API
Building and documenting a Rust API with Rocket Library 


To be able to run the project you should run Rust on nightly mode. To do so run `rustup override set nightly` to enable nightly mode just on this directory.

Rocket also works with the newest version of Rust. If the project doesn't compile please, run: `rustup update && cargo update`.

To start the project run: `cargo run`

## Endpoints
- GET: `/` -> Returns `Hello World` just for testing purposes.
